# ISBM-Publication-Consumer

This is one of the three-part series of proof-of-concept projects with the primary objective of constructing an interoperable IoT information cluster. The focus is on utilizing non-proprietary Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE) open standards. Each project within this series explores key facets of building a cohesive and scalable IoT infrastructure, demonstrating the potential of OIIE standards in promoting interoperability in the interconnect world.

Figure 1. The summary of the IoT demo using OIIE standards. Included in this three-part series are ISBM-2.0-Server-Adapter and ISBM-Publication-Provider, hosted in their respective repositories.
A demo Window application that receives and consumes measured data using the ISBM 2.0 Adapter.

### Objectives

Build a Windows application to receive published temperature data in CCOM format, embedded in the OAGIS BOD message via an ISBM 2.0 Server adapter from ISBM 2.0 adapter. Making it as an interoperable data consumer.
